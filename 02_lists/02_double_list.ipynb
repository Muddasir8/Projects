        "\n",
        "This Python code defines a function called `main` that iterates through a list of numbers, doubles each number, and prints the list after each modification. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Defining the `main` function:\n",
        "\n",
        "       def main():\n",
        "\n",
        "* The `def` keyword is used to define a function named `main`. This function encapsulates a block of code that will be executed when called.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Initializing the list:\n",
        "\n",
        "        numbers : list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* This line creates a variable called numbers and assigns it a list of integers: `[1, 2, 3, 4].`\n",
        "* The `list[int]` notation specifies that the variable `numbers` is expected to hold a list of integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Iterating through the list:\n",
        "\n",
        "       for i in range(len(numbers)):\n",
        "\n",
        "* This line starts a `for` loop that will iterate over each element in the `numbers` list.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `range(len(numbers))` creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to the length of the `numbers` list (which is 4 in this case). The loop variable `i` will take on each value in this sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Doubling each element:\n",
        "\n",
        "       index_element = numbers[i]\n",
        "            numbers[i] = index_element * 2\n",
        "\n",
        "* Inside the loop, these lines double the value of each element in the list:\n",
        "  * `index_element = numbers[i]` : This line assigns the current element of the list (accessed using `numbers[i]`) to a variable called `index_element`.\n",
        " * `numbers[i] = index_element * 2` : This line updates the current element of the list by multiplying `index_element` by 2 and assigning the result back to the same position in the list `(numbers[i])`.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Printing the list:\n",
        "\n",
        "       print(numbers)\n",
        "\n",
        "* This line prints the current state of the `numbers` list after each element is doubled.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Calling the `main` function:\n",
        "\n",
        "       if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
        "          main()\n",
        "\n",
        "* This block of code ensures that the `main` function is executed only when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).\n",
        "* `if __name__ == '__main__':` is a conditional statement that checks if the script is the main program being run.\n",
        "* If this condition is true, the `main()` function is called, which starts the execution of the code within the function."
