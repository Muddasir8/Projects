        "   * The `print` function is used to display the result, formatted using an f-string (`f\"There are {sec_in_year} in a year\"`). The f-string allows us to embed the value of `sec_in_year` directly within the string.\n",

        "* `if __name__ == '__main__':` is a common pattern in Python scripts.\n",
        "* If this condition is true, it calls the `main` function, thereby executing the code within it."
