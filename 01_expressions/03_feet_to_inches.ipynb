        "This Python code is a simple program that converts feet to inches. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Variable Declaration**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   This line declares a variable called `inches_in_foot` and assigns it the value `12`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The `: int` part is a type hint, indicating that the variable is expected to hold an integer value.\n",
        "*   This variable represents the number of inches in one foot, which is a constant value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Function Definition**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   This block defines a function called `main`.\n",
        "*   Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inside the `main` function:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Get Input:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   This line prompts the user to enter the number of feet using the `input()` function.\n",
        "*   The input is then converted to a floating-point number using `float()` and stored in the `feet` variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Calculate Inches:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   This line calculates the equivalent inches by multiplying the value of `feet` by `inches_in_foot` (which is 12)\n",
        "*   The result is stored in the `inches` variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Print the Result:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   This line displays the original feet value and the calculated inches value to the user.\n",
        "*   It uses an f-string (formatted string literal) to embed the values of `feet` and `inches` directly within the output string.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Program Execution:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   This block is crucial for running the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `if __name__ == '__main__':` is a conditional statement that checks if the script is being run as the main program.\n",
        "*   If this condition is true (which it will be when you run the script directly), it calls the `main()` function, executing the code within it. This starts the feet-to-inches conversion process.\n"
